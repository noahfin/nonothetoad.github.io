This is a simon says simulator. The popular hand held game displays a series of flashing colors and sounds. The playerâ€™s goal is to try and match the color sequence by clicking on each colors in the right order after the sequence finished displaying. Every time the player matches the sequence they move to the next round where one more color is added to the sequence.
